This project is ideal for learning Java-based GUI development and file handling for hospital management applications.

-- Short Description: Hospital Bed Management System (Java)  

This Java-based GUI application helps manage hospital bed allocations in General and ICU wards using Swing for UI design. The system allows users to:  

- View Bed Status: Displays occupied and available beds in a grid layout.  
- Admit Patients: Assigns patients to available beds.  
- Discharge Patients: Frees up occupied beds.  
- Ward Selection: Switch between General Ward (40 beds) and ICU (10 beds) using a menu.  
- Background & Logo Support: Custom panel for background images and hospital branding.  

The program is structured using OOP principles (Bed, Patient, and Hospital classes) and implements event-driven programming for interactivity.
